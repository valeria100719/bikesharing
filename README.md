# bikesharing

## Background

This project aims to explore data from New York's Bike Sharing to apply it to a possible similar business in Des Moines Iowa.

Despite the difference in size of the two cities, the data revealed many similarities between New York and Des Moines.

- Both cities are flat and in favor of cycling.
- Both have many miles of paved bike paths through their downtown areas.
- They're both commuter towns.

 ## Analysis Datas
 
### who are the users?
The first analysis was made on the basis of the type of users of the Bike sharing.
New York is a city famous for tourism, much less so. So this type of business will appeal to the residents of the city.

### Gender 
I also analyzed the gender of the users, the frequency of use and the days of preference.

As we can see from the graph, males use the bike sharing system more than female, and the peak of use is concentrated on Thursday.
these data are confirm by this other analysis:

The view above shows a similar breakdown but adds further analysis by gender.

### trips hours
Another statistic of interest is the usage per hour on the day of the week. The graph below is a heat map showing the most intense hours of use by day of the week (most intense blue).

In the graph below the analysis has been repeated and it is confirmed that males use bicycles much more than women, especially during the week day.

This analysis showed that the bike sharing activity is very much used by the resident population, which makes Des Moines a good city for this business.

Further analysis could be to analyze the type of users, whether they are workers or leisers bikers.
An annual analysis could be carried out to evaluate if there is a preference in months of the year for the use of bike sharing.
